3. Equity Researchers
4. Short-term Investors
5. Trading Platform users (eToro, Robinhood…)

## Future Scopes

2. Expand Social Media ingestion to new platforms (Reddit, blogs…)
3. Weightage for influential accounts
4. Include Cryptocurrencies
5. Implement Fraud Protection tool (Pump-and-Dump maneuvers on the rise)
6. Add price manipulation Alert
